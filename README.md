## Contribution 1: care_fe (OHC Network)

**Repository:** [ohcnetwork/care_fe](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe)

**Issue:** [#14040 — Discount Monetary Component form validation bugs](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/issues/14040)

**Pull Request:** [#16473 — fix: correct validation bugs in DiscountMonetaryComponentForm](https://github.com/ohcnetwork/care_fe/pull/16473)

**Branch:** [`themidix:issues/14040/fix-discount-component-validation`](https://github.com/themidix/care_fe/tree/issues/14040/fix-discount-component-validation)

### Problem Summary

The Create Discount Component form (`DiscountMonetaryComponentForm.tsx`) had three related validation bugs:

1. **Whitespace-only title bypass** — `z.string().min(1)` counts raw characters, so a title of `"   "` passed validation instead of being rejected as empty.
2. **Raw Zod type error surfaced to the user** — clearing the Amount or Factor input passes `null` into a `z.string()` schema chain, which throws Zod's internal `"Expected string, received null"` error before any custom, user-friendly message can run.
3. **Save button enabled on an invalid form** — the button was only gated on `!isDirty` (was a field touched?), not on whether the form was actually valid, so it could be clicked while validation errors were still showing.

### Fix Summary

- Added `.trim()` before `.min(1)` on the `title` field so whitespace-only input is correctly rejected.
- Wrapped the `factor` and `amount` schemas in `z.preprocess(val => val ?? "", ...)` to coerce `null`/`undefined` to an empty string before validation runs, so the friendly "This field is required" message fires instead of the raw Zod error.
- Updated the Save button's `disabled` condition from `!isDirty` to `!isDirty || !isValid`, so it only becomes clickable once the form is genuinely valid.
- Added a new Playwright end-to-end spec (`discountMonetaryComponentCreate.spec.ts`) covering: Save disabled on empty form, whitespace-only title rejection, empty amount/factor rejection, out-of-range factor rejection, and a full successful-creation happy path.

### Review Status

The PR received automated review (CodeRabbit, Greptile) and a maintainer review from `nihal467`, which requested changes:
- Update the issue number reference and complete the merge checklist.
- Resolve outstanding AI-reviewer comments, notably:
  - Use `??` (nullish coalescing) instead of `||` in the `factor` field's value binding, since `||` incorrectly converts a valid `0` to an empty string.
  - Several Playwright assertions were written to `click()` the Save button in states where it's expected to be disabled (post-fix); these need to assert `toBeDisabled()` instead of clicking.
  - Remove `CONTRIBUTING_README.md`, a personal working file that was accidentally included in the PR diff and doesn't belong in the shared repository.

## Contribution 2: Frank!Framework

**Repository:** [frankframework/frankframework](https://github.com/frankframework/frankframework)

**Issue:** [#4739 — In Larva tests, there should be a mechanism to wait for a condition to become true](https://github.com/frankframework/frankframework/issues/4739)

**Branch:** [`feature/4739-larva-waitfor-condition`](https://github.com/themidix/frankframework/tree/feature/4739-larva-waitfor-condition)

### Problem Summary

Frank!Framework's Larva integration-test tool executes scenario steps (read/write against senders, listeners, databases, filesystems, etc.) as single, synchronous actions and compares the result against an expected file. There is currently no way to express "wait until this condition becomes true, polling with a timeout" — for example, waiting for an asynchronously-written row to appear in an error/message store after an adapter times out.

Today, the only workaround is a fixed-duration wait (`sleep`) inserted before the read step. This is either:
- **too short**, causing intermittent, flaky test failures when the async write hasn't completed yet, or
- **too long**, unnecessarily slowing down the whole test suite.

The issue requests a proper polling/wait-for-condition mechanism as a first-class Larva feature.

### My Understanding of the Fix

The most promising approach is to extend Larva's existing per-step action model (`org.frankframework.larva.actions`, and the step-execution logic in `ScenarioRunner`) with optional `waitfor.timeout` / `waitfor.interval` properties on a step. When set, the step retries its read-and-compare cycle on the given interval until either the expected result is produced or the timeout elapses — falling back to today's single-shot behavior when the properties are absent, so no existing scenario is affected.

Based on maintainer/community feedback on the issue (from nielsm5), the wait condition is being generalized to support an **expression** (`waitfor.xPath` / `waitfor.jPath`) evaluated against the actual result on each poll, rather than only a full-content comparison — better suited to async cases where only part of the result matters (e.g. "does a row with type=E exist" rather than a byte-for-byte match). If no expression is given, the mechanism falls back to full-result comparison.

### Reproduction Steps

1. Create a Larva scenario where step N triggers a message that is asynchronously written to a table (e.g. via `ManageDatabase`), simulating the Heinenoord case — an adapter times out and an error-store row is written on a background thread.
2. Add a subsequent step that immediately queries for that row.
3. Run the scenario: the query executes once, finds no row yet (the async write hasn't completed), and the step fails — even though the row appears moments later.
4. Confirm the only current workaround is a fixed-duration `sleep` step before the query, and that shortening it introduces flakiness while lengthening it slows the suite.

### Solution Plan

1. **`Step.java`** — add `getWaitForTimeoutMillis()`, `getWaitForIntervalMillis()`, and `getWaitForExpression()` to parse and validate the new `waitfor.*` properties, with scenario-load-time validation.
2. **`ScenarioRunner.java`** — add `executeActionReadStepWithRetry()`, invoked only when `waitfor.timeout > 0`. Polls `executeRead()` on the configured interval; checks the condition silently until met or timed out; reports the final outcome exactly once via the existing `compareResult()` path.
3. **`LarvaTool.java`** — extract a pure `computeComparison()` helper from `compareResult()` for reuse as a silent equality check during polling; add `evaluateWaitForExpression()` for the XPath/JSONPath case.
4. **Tests** — parameterized `Step` property tests; `LarvaTool` tests for the extracted comparison logic; new `ScenarioRunnerTest` covering retry-until-match, timeout, and expression-based match.
5. **Docs** — update the Frank!Manual Larva properties reference with a Heinenoord-style worked example.
